Hello, this is the Read Me for a simple calculator.
This project is made with python and it includes the basic mathematics opperations and is being made to train my coding.
The program beggins asking you to choose one of them, after that, choose to values for the selected opperation.
It'll show you the result and ask if you want to continue the calculations with that result or if you want to stop.

For percentage opperation: There are 2 types of opperation here, the first is the calculation of how much is X percentage of Y number, the second is based on the Rule of Three, calculation how much (%) Y is of a base number X.
For Logarithm: The calculator does not have a base, so it will ask you to provide one. If you try to calculate the log of negative numbers or zero, it'll show you a error message, as those are undefined in simple math.

Thanks for having a look at this code.

PS: This is a begginer's code, a first calculator done with python.

Future Features:

[ X ] The project should got back to the beggining after you finish a calculation.

[ X ] The project should calculate a how much x% is from N number given by the user. 

[ X ] From the percentage tab, the calculator should give an option to calculate the percentage of Y number based on X number.

[ X ] Include a stop if the person tries to calculate a negative percentage.

[ X ] Better explain the second percentage opperation

[ X ] Include square root

[ X ] Include exponentiation

[ X ] Include logarithm opperation

This project is made with python and it includes the basic mathematics operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication and division) as well as more advanced calculation, as square roots, percentages, exponentiation and logarithms. Made to consolidate the knowledge on basic logic and simple python operators and command lines.


The program begin asking you to choose one of them, after that, choose the operation based on the table presented.


For sums, subtractions, multiplication and divisions, you can make the operation again for the total value of a prior calculation or start over.


For percentage operation: There are 2 types of operation here, the first is the calculation of how much is X percentage of Y number, the second is based on the Rule of Three, calculation how much (%) Y is from X.


For Logarithm: the calculator will ask you a number to calculate the logarithm of AND will ask you the base for the log.



Thanks for having a look at this code.

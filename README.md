Hello, this is the Read Me for a simple python calculator.


This project is made with python and it includes the basic mathematics operations and is being made to train my coding.


The program begin asking you to choose one of them, after that, choose the operation based on the table presented.


For sums, subtractions, multiplication and divisions, you can make the operation again for the total value of a prior calculation or start over.


For percentage operation: There are 2 types of operation here, the first is the calculation of how much is X percentage of Y number, the second is based on the Rule of Three, calculation how much (%) Y is from X.


For Logarithm: the calculator will ask you a number to calculate the logarithm of AND will ask you the base for the log.



Thanks for having a look at this code.

Future Features:

[ X ] The project should got back to the beggining after you finish a calculation.

[ X ] The project should calculate a how much x% is from N number given by the user. 

[ X ] From the percentage tab, the calculator should give an option to calculate the percentage of Y number based on X number.

[ X ] Include a stop if the person tries to calculate a negative percentage.

[ X ] Better explain the second percentage operation

[ X ] Include square root

[ X ] Include exponentiation

[ X ] Include logarithm operation
